express-user-lb-jquery
======================

Flexible client-side logic that works with the express-user-local/express-user/express-user-local-basic stack.

It comes with an optional server to serve the client-side files, views and client logic.

Status
======

Currently in development. Functionality not finished. Atm, consider this a backup of a work in progress.

Originally planned to start with a express-user-lb-angular project, but after spending 4 days learning about Angular and implementing this in Angular, I unfortunately found out I don't like Angular all that much. I know it has a lot of momentum and I really, really wanted to like it, but gotta call a spade a spade :(.

0.0.1-alpha.1
